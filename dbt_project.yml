# Project variables

vars:
  organization: "DRC"  # Name of the organization or business unit which owns the FHIR data. Used for titles in the analytics reports. [string]
  database: "aou-datawarehouse-sandbox"  # Name of the Google Cloud project that contains the BigQuery data. Used to connect to your FHIR data. [string]
  schema: "ppi_001"  # Name of the BigQuery dataset storing the FHIR data. Used to connect to your FHIR data. [string]
  source_system_default: "DRC-PPI"  # Default to populate as the 'source_system' in metrics when this is not extracted from the FHIR data. [string]
  site_default: "DRC PPI"  # Default to populate as the 'site' in metrics when this is not extracted from the FHIR data. [string]
  data_transfer_type_default: "BigQuery"  # Default to populate as the 'data_transfer_type' in metrics when this is not extracted from the FHIR data. [string]
  timezone_default: "America/New_York"  # Default time zone for this dataset. The IANA time-zone name. For example, "Europe/London". [string]
  static_dataset: TRUE  # TRUE if the dataset is static; FALSE if the dataset is being dynamically updated. [boolean]
  earliest_date: "2009-10-01"  # If static_dataset = TRUE then input the earliest date for the data. This is used to restrict metric output date ranges. Use format: "YYYY-MM-DD". [string]
  latest_date: "2019-09-23"  # If static_dataset = TRUE then input the latest date for the data. This is used to restrict metric output date ranges. Use format: "YYYY-MM-DD". [string]
  months_history: 12  # For a dynamic dataset (static_dataset = FALSE) the number of months in the past from current_date to include in metric output. [integer]
  length_of_stay_cap: 90  # Default argument to pass to cap_encounter_end_date macro which caps encounter length of stay at this number of days to limit the effect of long stay encounters on metrics. [integer]
  null_values: [""]  # List of string values to be considered as missing data when evaluating whether a field is recorded. [list]
  persist_all_metric_executions: FALSE  # Whether to enable metric_all model which incrementally adds the output from every execution of the metrics pipeline. [boolean]
  cohort: "all_patients"  # Run metrics for a specific group of patients defined in models/cohorts/. For example, "adults". Use "all_patients" to disable cohort filtering. [string]
  cohort_snapshot_date: "today"  # Date on which to evaluate patient membership of cohort. Default of "today" will evaluate membership as of today using CURRENT_DATE(). Use format: "YYYY-MM-DD". [string]
  drop_metric_tables: TRUE  # TRUE to drop intermediate metric tables. Pro: Fewer tables in the dataset. Con: Takes quite a bit of time.
  print_why_metric_empty: FALSE  # Prints what inputs are missing for metrics.
  init_sources_fhir_resource_list: "Encounter,Observation,Patient"  # List of FHIR resources to call init_sources on.
  init_sources_parquet_location: ""  # File location with Parquet files for init_sources.
